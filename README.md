# Clone the Repository

If you would like to follow along the challenges, you'll need to first [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and then clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/adamgiese/knowgitsherlock
```

# Run Locally

1. Clone the Repository (instructions above)
2. Navigate to the project (`cd knowgitsherlock`)
3. Install dependencies (`npm install`)
4. Run locally (`npx eleventy --serve`)
