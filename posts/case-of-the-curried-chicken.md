There has been an attempt on Sherlock's life! Somebody has manipulated the recipe that Mrs. Hudson uses for her curried chicken recipe, nearly resulting in the poisoning of our esteemed consulting detective. Luckily, Sherlock has a very acute sense of smell which detected the poison before any damage was done.

This week's challenge is to find out who can be blamed for such a dastardly scheme.
