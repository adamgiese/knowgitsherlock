## git is hard...

...but it shouldn't be boring. The purpose of "Know git, Sherlock!" is to teach how to solve a variety of problems using git using Sherlock Holmes as a theme and backdrop. Some of these problems may be git related in nature - such as the untangling of a merge conflict. Sometimes, the _problem_ may not be related to git, but a possible _solution_ is! 

## Getting started!

There are only two things that you need to get started: [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and clone the [Know git, Sherlock!](https://github.com/adamgiese/knowgitsherlock) repository!
