Professor Moriarty is the archenemy of Sherlock Holmes. Refered to by Holmes as 'the Napoleon of crime' who has 'a brain of the first order', he has become an absolutely iconic villain. Given his stature, you might be surprised the he appears in only a single Holmes story. He is, however, mentioned various times after his first appearance.

The original text of Sherlock Holmes is available within the `holmes` directory of this repository. Try and use `git` to find the following:

1. In which stories is Moriarty mentioned by name?
2. In all of the stories, where is Moriarty brought up only a single time?
